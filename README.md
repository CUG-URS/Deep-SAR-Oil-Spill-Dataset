The dataset consists of two study areas and is mainly used for scientific purposes.

The dataset contains the Gulf of Mexico oil spill area and the Persian Gulf oil spill area, acquired from the ALOS and Sentinel-1A satellites, respectively. It is a pixel-level dataset of oil spills and non-oil spills collected and produced by the ECHO research team.

Among them, 3101 samples from the Mexican oil spill area were used for model training and 776 samples were used for testing. 

From the Persian Gulf oil spill area, 3354 samples were used for training and 839 samples were used for testing.
